  <h1>Deviled Eggs</h1>
    <p>A southern treat to beat the heat</p>

  <section id="ingredients">
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>12 room temperature eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup mayonnaise (We prefer Duke's)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons of stone ground or old style mustard</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of white distilled vineger</li>
        <li>Smoked paprika for garnish</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 piping bag (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Fill a pot with enough water to cover eggs and bring to a boil. Eggs should not be in the water at this point.</li>
      <li>Once water is boiling, turn the heat down to a simmer. Then gently add the eggs to the water. Cover if you have a lid and simmer for 13 minutes.</li>
      <li>Gently remove the eggs from the water and rinse them with cold water to stop them from cooking. You want to be gentle when adding the eggs to the pot and when taking them out so you can avoid cracking/egg destruction.</li>
      <li>Peel the eggs and set them aside for a few mintues so they can fully cool. Allowing them to cool will help you remove the yolks more easily later.</li>
      <li>Cut the eggs in half long ways/hotdog style and remove the yolks. The easiet was to remove the yolks is the gently pull on albumen surrounding the yoke so that the yoke unsticks from the sides. Then pop it out by pulling it from the sides.</li>
      <li>In a bowl, mix together yolks, mayo, mustard, vineger, salt, and pepper. We've gotten crazy before and added 1 tsp of smoked paprika at this stage as well but you can do as you please. You want to mix until the mixture is as smooth as possible. Lumps will happen but the smaller they are, the easier it will be to pipe later.</li>
      <li>If you are using a piping bag, place the bag into a tall glass and fill it with the yolk mixture. Leave enough room in the bag so that you can twist it closed. Overfilling will it make much harder to fill the eggs.</li>
      <li>Line up your eggs and fill them with the yolk mixture. If you don't have a piping bag, you can use a spoon.</li>
      <li>Garnish with smoked paprika and serve.</li>
    </ol>
